      <h2>Oman Railway 3D Animation</h2>
      <p>
        This 3D animation presents the concept of Oman Railway through a cinematic motion-graphics sequence.
        Created in Adobe After Effects, it features dynamic 3D cubes and text layers that symbolize movement,
        innovation, and the modern infrastructure of Oman’s railway system.

      <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
      <p>
        The 3D Oman Railway sequence was designed and animated using <strong>Adobe After Effects</strong>,
        taking advantage of its 3D workspace to produce depth, camera motion, and spatial realism.
        The project began with the creation of 3D square layers representing moving panels of infrastructure,
        each labeled with text such as “Oman Railway”. These cubes were placed in 3D space using the
        <em>3D Layer Switch</em> to define their position across X, Y, and Z axes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keyframes were applied to the <em>Position</em> and <em>Rotation</em> properties to animate smooth movement
        through the virtual environment. A <strong>Camera Layer</strong> was introduced to simulate real-world
        perspective and dynamic motion, while <strong>Ambient and Spot Lights</strong> added highlights and
        shadows for depth. <strong>Motion Blur</strong> was enabled to enhance realism, and <strong>Depth of Field</strong>
        focused viewer attention on the central title “Welcome to 3D Oman Railway”.
        Color gradients and shadows were applied to emphasize contrast and professional tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The animation concludes with a cinematic transition and spatial camera pull-back that reveals the
        full scene. The rendered composition was exported in <strong>MP4 format</strong> for web playback using the
        <strong>Classic 3D Renderer</strong>. This piece demonstrates effective control of 3D layering,
        lighting, and animation principles inside After Effects — successfully meeting the GIS6009 3D element
        requirement by integrating artistic motion design with technical 3D composition to visualize Oman Railway’s
        progress and innovation.
