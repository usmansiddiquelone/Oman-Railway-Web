      <h2>Final Evaluation & Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        The Oman Railway Multimedia Project was developed as a complete web-based portfolio integrating image, video, audio, and 3D elements to represent the technological and infrastructural development of the Oman Railway.
        Each phase focused on a specific multimedia discipline, applying creative and technical tools to build a cohesive and professional presentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the <strong>Image Editing phase</strong>, Adobe Photoshop was used for enhancement and color correction of photographs related to Oman’s railways.
        Techniques such as exposure balancing, tone adjustment, and sharpness refinement were applied to achieve professional visual output.
        This helped me understand the principles of visual communication and how digital editing can enhance narrative impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Video Editing phase</strong> was completed in <strong>CapCut Desktop</strong>.
        Here, I imported original video clips and arranged them using a multi-layered timeline.
        I added animated text overlays, transitions, and visual effects such as color correction, zoom, and motion blur.
        The project aimed to depict movement, innovation, and progress — qualities that align with the Oman Railway’s identity.
        Synchronizing background music and narration within CapCut improved my understanding of pacing and audiovisual synchronization.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the <strong>Audio Editing phase</strong>, I used <strong>Adobe Audition</strong> to record, edit, and mix original sound.
        Tools such as Noise Reduction, Dynamic Processing, and the Parametric Equalizer were applied to remove background noise, compress dynamic range, and balance frequencies.
        Reverb effects were used to add spatial realism, while amplitude envelopes helped maintain consistency between different sound layers.
        The result was a polished, noise-free audio track exported in both WAV and MP3 formats for web integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the <strong>3D Animation phase</strong>, I worked in <strong>Adobe After Effects</strong> to create a short 3D animation of cubes and text layers that represented the Oman Railway theme.
        The project utilized 3D camera layers, lighting, motion blur, and depth of field to simulate cinematic depth.
        This phase strengthened my technical control over spatial animation, camera keyframes, and composition design.
      </p>

      <p>
        The entire web structure was built with <strong>HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</strong>.
        Each multimedia element was embedded with responsive layout and custom playback controls.
        The biggest challenge was maintaining compatibility between different formats and ensuring smooth playback across browsers.
        I overcame this by converting all files into optimized MP4 and MP3 formats and testing the site in multiple browsers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, the Oman Railway Web Project has enhanced my practical understanding of multimedia integration, workflow planning, and digital storytelling.
        I learned to blend creativity with technical precision while working with professional tools like Photoshop, CapCut, Audition, and After Effects.
        This project not only improved my editing and animation skills but also deepened my appreciation for how multimedia can communicate innovation and progress effectively.
